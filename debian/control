Package: python-pyasn1
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}
Breaks: python-pysnmp4 (<< 4.3.4)
Description: ASN.1 library for Python (Python 2 module)
 This  is  an implementation  of  ASN.1  types  and codecs  in  Python
 programming language. It has been first written to support particular
 protocol (SNMP) but then generalized  to be suitable for a wide range
 of protocols based on ASN.1 specification.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 module.
